Guest House Performance Optimization

This project focuses on optimizing guest house operations through dynamic pricing models and human resource analysis. Using structured data on guests, employees, competitors, and customer feedback, I applied Python, Excel to identify data-driven strategies for improving occupancy, maximizing revenue, and enhancing guest satisfaction. The study highlights how pricing flexibility and employee engagement directly impact business performance, making it a valuable case of applying business analytics and data science to real-world decision-making.
